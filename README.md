# winventory-rs

`winventory-rs` is a small Rust-based Windows asset inventory tool for defensive security assessment.

It collects basic local host metadata and prints it as JSON:

- hostname
- Windows product name
- Windows display version / release ID
- Windows build number
- installed browser versions for Chrome, Edge, and Firefox where available

## Purpose

The tool is designed for small-scale defensive security assessment and lab work. It provides a lightweight way to collect basic OS and browser version information from a Windows host without installing an agent or collecting sensitive user data.

This kind of inventory is useful for:

- identifying outdated operating system builds
- identifying outdated browser versions
- basic asset visibility
- small-organisation security reviews
- lab exercises around local enumeration and defensive telemetry

## Privacy and Scope

This tool does **not** collect:

- credentials
- documents
- browser history
- cookies
- saved passwords
- network traffic
- personal files

It only queries local OS and browser version metadata.

## How It Works

The tool uses standard Windows mechanisms:

- `reg query` for registry-based version information
- PowerShell `Get-Item` for executable product versions when registry values are unavailable
- Rust `std::process::Command` to invoke local system commands
- JSON output for downstream processing

## Example Output

```json
{
  "hostname": "DESKTOP-EXAMPLE",
  "os": {
    "product_name": "Windows 11 Pro",
    "display_version": "23H2",
    "build": "22631"
  },
  "browsers": {
    "chrome": "124.0.6367.91",
    "edge": "124.0.2478.67",
    "firefox": null
  }
}
